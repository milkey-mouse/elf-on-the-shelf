# elf-on-the-shelf
elf-on-the-shelf is a really small "test-runner" for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). 

# Usage
Make each day a function in `answers.py`, like this:
```python
def day1(text):
    return 42
```

#Spoiler Alert
The `master` branch will just contain a template for day 1 and no spoilers. However, `spoilery` will contain my latest attempts at solving the puzzles, so if you want to avoid spoilers, stay on `master`.
