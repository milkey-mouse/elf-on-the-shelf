# elf-on-the-shelf
elf-on-the-shelf is a really small "test-runner" for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). 

# Usage
Make each day as a function, like this:
```python
def day1(text):
    return 42
```

#Spoiler Alert
`spoilery.py` will contain my latest attempts to solve each day's challenges.
`elf-on-the-shelf.py` will just contain a template for day 1 and no spoilers. So if you don't want to spoil the latest puzzles, don't look at `spoilery.py`.
